<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Several cases which I witnessed led me
to believe, some years ago, that inflammation
of the brain, or its membranes,
might be produced in children, owing to
their being suckled for an undue length of
time. Since that period, having enjoyed
opportunities of observing infantile diseases
on a much more extended scale, and my
attention being expressly directed to the
point in question, I not only became fully
convinced of the correctness of my previous
conclusions, but was induced to carry
them still farther.</p>

<p>My opinions on this subject were briefly
drawn up and published in the <i>Medical
and Physical Journal</i> for August 1827,
and have not passed altogether unnoticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
by my professional brethren<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, some of
whom have done me the honour to speak
of them in flattering terms, while no one,
I believe, has attempted to disprove the
existence of the important fact I was the
first to announce.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Vide Medico-Chirurgical Review, Gazette of Health, Dendy
on Cutaneous Diseases, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The bare statement of that fact was,
indeed, nearly all that my approaching
departure from England, at the time last
mentioned, left in my power: upon the
present occasion I have offered arguments
for, and endeavoured to anticipate those
against, the deductions I then made public;
and however imperfect may have been my
success in either, the welfare of society at
large is too deeply involved in the establishment
of my opinions with respect to
the custom I condemn, (if those opinions
be correct,) for me to hesitate while again
committing them to the press in a more
extended form.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>These considerations, I respectfully submit,
will render any apology for the appearance
of the following pages unnecessary,
and will, I trust, secure for them
a candid and favourable reception from
the Profession and the Public.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Breast-Milk, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i></h3>


<p>No sooner has the child been ushered into the
world than the breasts of the mother pour
forth their milk for its sustenance. This bland
fluid is secreted from the blood, and varies, in
quality and quantity, according to the time
which has elapsed from delivery, being peculiarly
and wonderfully adapted at every period
to the wants of the individual for whose use
it is destined. Thus, that first secreted, called
<i>colostrum</i>, possesses a purgative quality evidently
intended by the all-wise Author of our
being for the purpose of removing <i>the meconium</i><a href="#Note_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>,&mdash;a
process which experience has sufficiently
proved to be necessary for the welfare
of the newly-born infant. Afterwards, ceasing
to possess this aperient property, it is
calculated solely for affording nutrition; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
finally, at a certain period from delivery, it
gradually becomes impoverished, loses its
former healthy qualities altogether, and acquires
others which are injurious to life. This
important change, as above noticed, generally
happens at a certain period after delivery;
varying, however, somewhat in particular
women, and in the same female on different
occasions: but, from disease, or other circumstances,
the milk may become deteriorated
before the time to which reference has just
been made. If, for instance, the mother labour
under any serious disorder, it is universally
admitted that her milk may also become
unhealthy; and this may take place even a
short interval after delivery.</p>

<p>Although we cannot explain how the brain
and nerves act, and probably never shall be
able to do so, yet we are well aware that their
influence is absolutely requisite for the healthy
performance of every function in the human
body.</p>

<p>That mental inquietude will impede digestion
is a fact familiar to almost every one;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
but, I believe, it is not so generally known,
that it will with no less certainty retard and
alter the nature of the secretion furnished by
the breasts of the lactescent female. Violent
affections of the mind will cause the milk to
become thin and yellowish, and to acquire
noxious properties: even the fond mother's
anxiety, while hanging over the couch of her
sick infant, will be sufficient to render it unfit
for the sustenance of the object of her solicitude.</p>

<p>The state also of the stomach and bowels
and the diet of the nurse materially and constantly
influence the nature of the lacteal
secretion.</p>

<p>The milk, besides, is liable to deterioration
from another cause, namely, the recurrence of
the usual periodical appearance&mdash;for should
this take place in a nurse, it is agreed that
her milk is liable to produce disorders in the
child who imbibes it; which could not happen,
if the former possessed its ordinary component
parts, and retained its natural properties.</p>

<p>The recurrence, moreover, of pregnancy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the lactescent female may render the milk of
a bad quality, and will invariably lessen its
quantity. Mr. Burns asserts that in these
cases the milk 'does not become hurtful,' but
in this opinion I must beg leave to differ from
him; since I have repeatedly seen it, from
this cause, palpably altered in appearance,
and have observed diarrh&#339;a and great debility
produced in the children who were
suckled with it.</p>

<p>An almost universally received opinion
among females, and, indeed, one very frequently
entertained by members of the medical
profession, is, that while a woman continues
to nurse her infant she will not again
become pregnant; but this, as a general proposition,
is unquestionably erroneous; it is
even doubtful whether such opinion will hold
good in a majority of instances. The continuance
of lactation will very generally, it is
true, tend to prevent the recurrence of the
periodical phenomenon; yet, nevertheless, it
will not in every instance prevent pregnancy<a href="#Note_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>.
Should, however, a woman with an infant at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the breast again become pregnant, (a circumstance
that very frequently occurs, and of
which, from the <i>general though not invariable</i>
absence of those criteria by which this fact
is accustomed to be recognised, she is not
aware until it has made some progress,) one of
two things will usually take place; either she
will miscarry, or her milk will become impoverished
in quality and diminished in quantity.
Nor is this wonderful:&mdash;it was not intended
by Nature that the processes of pregnancy and
lactation should go on simultaneously, but, on
the contrary, that the one should commence
when the other had terminated; and experience
sufficiently proves that they will not
proceed well together: the reason of which, as
it appears to me, may be easily given. During
pregnancy, and particularly during its latter
periods, the vessels of the womb gradually
enlarge, and a much greater quantity of blood
than usual is determined to that organ for
the increase and perfection of the embryo
and its appendages; which, after delivery,
becomes transferred to the breasts to supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the material for the secretion of the milk:
but if, during pregnancy, lactation be also
persevered in, the blood becomes directed at
the same time to two different parts of the
body, somewhat remote from each other,
namely, to the womb, and to the breasts;
hence, neither is likely to receive its due proportion
of this vital fluid, and, consequently,
the functions of one or the other, or both, are
liable to become impeded or suspended. If
the breasts continue to receive a sufficient
quantity of blood, the secretion of milk goes
on properly, but the womb is deprived of its
necessary supply; the embryo, in consequence,
languishes and dies, and, becoming an extraneous
body, is thrown off, producing abortion;
while, on the other hand, should the
womb still obtain its due proportion of blood,
the breasts are robbed of it, and the secretion
of milk, if not altogether suppressed, is rendered
either deficient in quantity or deteriorated
in quality.</p>

<p>Finally, the breast-milk may become depraved
and injurious by the process of lactation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
being continued too long, a practice
which is, unfortunately, in this, as well as
other countries, extensively prevalent.</p>

<p>I have not yet had an opportunity of examining
the breast-milk in these diseased conditions
except by the eye, and that rarely&mdash;but
even this slight examination has enabled
me to state, that it was greatly altered from
its natural condition;&mdash;that it was more fluid
than usual, and changed in colour, resembling
a yellowish turbid serum, instead of displaying
its well-known bluish hue.</p>

<p>I propose in future to attend carefully to
this subject, and I would beg leave to recommend
it as one well worthy the notice of those
members of our profession who have made
animal chemistry a particular study, having
no doubt that they would be able, by a series
of accurate experiments upon the breast-milk
at different periods after delivery, and under
various conditions of the mother, to collect
many interesting and important facts&mdash;such,
perhaps, as would tend very materially to
augment our knowledge of pathology, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
improve our practice in the treatment of certain
diseases<a href="#Note_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>.</p>

<p>We cannot but believe that the Supreme
Being has done nothing without an infinitely
wise and good object, and it is obviously our
interest, no less than our duty, to be guided by
those indications of the Divine purpose which
are distinctly to be traced throughout the
creation.</p>

<p>It must appear evident to all who examine
the matter in question, that the infant was
intended to be nourished for the first few
months of its existence through the medium
of a fluid; because no teeth are provided to
prepare for its use substances of a more solid
description; and there can be no doubt that
this fluid is the mother's milk;&mdash;but when
the child has attained a certain age the teeth
begin to appear, doubtless at the precise time
when they are meant to be used; and, therefore,
more solid food should now be given.
Besides, in consequence of its new acquisition,
the child sucks less perfectly than
before, an additional proof that weaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ought at this period to be commenced. Indeed,
the teeth are calculated indirectly to
produce this effect themselves, the mother
being now liable to suffer inconvenience by
letting the child take the breast&mdash;for the latter
<i>bites</i> instead of <i>sucking</i> the nipple, and the
pain hence arising may, perhaps, induce the
former, for her own sake, to discontinue a
practice injurious to both.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered, that when the
teeth are usually produced, the milk loses its
nutritious properties, and this too at a time
when the infant from his increasing size must
evidently require a more solid and substantial,
rather than a thinner and less nourishing diet.
What rational argument, therefore, can be
offered why he should still be suckled? If
we observe the brute creation, do any analogies
appear by which we can defend the propriety
in the human species of protracted suckling?
by no means:&mdash;on the contrary, we find that
the female animals soon drive away their
young from their dugs; and what is, perhaps,
still more to the purpose, I have heard stated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
on good authority, as a well-known fact among
the breeders of cattle, that if calves be allowed
to suck beyond a few months they do not thrive,
but, on the contrary, become lean and diseased.</p>

<p>The belief so generally prevailing, that the
longer a child is suckled the stronger it will
become, is a prejudice, like many others concerning
women and children, which has been
handed down from mother to daughter for
ages, and has thereby become so universally
entertained and so deeply rooted in the minds
of females, that even medical men scarcely
venture to question its propriety. My own
experience, however, compels me to declare,
that there is not a more erroneous or mischievous
doctrine; and I can most truly
affirm, that I never yet witnessed an instance
where protracted lactation had produced any
good effect<a href="#Note_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>, though I have seen numerous
examples (some of which will be introduced
hereafter) where, I believe, it had been the
indirect cause of death.</p>

<p>Having thus strongly noticed the impropriety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of long continued suckling, it will,
perhaps, be proper to state my opinion as to
the period when this process should terminate.
As a general rule, at nine months after birth
the child ought to be entirely weaned; and
in no instance should he be permitted to suck
more than ten. In many cases suckling
may be relinquished with advantage (and
occasionally it is absolutely necessary to discontinue
it) before the time first above mentioned;
in others, however, it may be protracted
beyond it.</p>

<p>I by no means recommend the breast-milk
to be at once superseded by artificial food, but,
on the contrary, that the child should be
<i>gradually</i> accustomed to such aliment from a
much earlier period; the proportion of the
latter being increased by degrees, while the
breast-milk is diminished in a corresponding
ratio. Hence we shall produce a double advantage;
the mother will be benefited as well
as the child&mdash;the former, by giving suck less
frequently, and in smaller quantities at a time
than usual, will have the secretion of milk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<i>gradually lessened</i>, and, therefore all likelihood of
inconvenience, as far as regards herself when
the child is entirely weaned, will be completely
prevented; while, on the other hand,
the child being <i>insensibly estranged</i> from the
breast, will have become accustomed to his
new food, so that there will be less chance of
its disagreeing with him when it forms his
sole support; and thus the danger which is
generally apprehended from weaning will
be either materially lessened or altogether
avoided.</p>

<p>The difficulty of bringing up infants by
hand, as it is termed, is well known; but I
suspect that the great mortality which has
been recorded as occurring from this source
is not inseparable from the practice itself, but
arises mainly from the improper manner in
which it is usually conducted. When it is
determined to bring up an infant by hand, the
substitute offered for the mother's milk should
as nearly as possible resemble that fluid; and
the child should be constrained to imbibe it
in <i>the same manner as</i> it would <i>the milk from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> maternal breast</i>; that is, it should be <i>sucked</i> from
a bottle contrived for that purpose, instead of
the child being gorged with it, by means of a
large spoon, or some other equally improper
instrument, as is the usual custom. It is a
fact too palpable to be questioned, that the
food generally given to infants brought up by
hand is not only administered in an improper
manner, but is also of an improper quality;
their tender stomachs are daily overloaded
with <i>solid</i> instead of <i>liquid</i> aliment, and hence
arises the numerous train of evils which, in
my opinion, produce the great mortality just
referred to.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><i>On Lactation, and the Disorders frequently produced in
Women by that process.</i></h3>


<p>There can be no doubt that, speaking generally,
a mother is bound to suckle her children,
and that the performance of this duty
is no less conducive to her own health than to
the moral and physical welfare of her offspring;
yet there is not a more unfounded
doctrine than that which presumes every
woman who is willing to be also capable of
advantageously discharging the important
office of a nurse.</p>

<p>If the mother enjoy good health, and the
process be not continued too long, it is likely
to produce beneficial effects both in herself
and her infant; but if she be of a very delicate
habit&mdash;labour under any dangerous
disease&mdash;be subject during the period of lactation
to great affliction, or constant mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
inquietude&mdash;or should the periodical appearance
return, pregnancy occur, or suckling be
continued too long, it may not only prove
highly detrimental to herself, but may be the
means of occasioning serious or fatal consequences
to her child.</p>

<p>In cases of extreme delicacy of constitution,
lactation will often produce the worst
effects. Many young ladies, on becoming
mothers, are incapable of supporting the
constant drain to which the wants of their
infants subject them&mdash;they lose their good
looks, become gradually weaker, and as their
strength declines, their milk is simultaneously
lessened in quantity, and altered in its other
properties.</p>

<p>If the suckling be still continued, their debility
daily increases, distressing pains in the
back and loins succeed; the patients become
exceedingly nervous, as it is termed, and are
unusually susceptible of ordinary impressions;
pain in the head, often of great violence,
follows, which, in some cases, is succeeded
by delirium, in others, by absolute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mania. Nor is this the whole catalogue of
ills to which in such cases the unfortunate
mother is subjected: the appetite fails, distressing
languor is experienced by day, while
copious perspirations deluge her by night,
and dissipate the last remains of strength&mdash;producing
a state which may easily be mistaken
for, or terminate in, true pulmonary
consumption;&mdash;finally, the sight becomes
progressively weaker, until vision is almost
destroyed; the eyelids exude a glutinous
secretion, and ophthalmia itself is occasionally
induced.</p>

<p>These are the symptoms too often caused
by lactation in delicate or debilitated habits,
even a few months after delivery; the same
also are observed when suckling has been injudiciously
protracted beyond the period to
which it should be confined.</p>

<p>A few only of the foregoing symptoms may
be noticed, or nearly the whole may present
themselves, in the same patient; and when
this happens, unless the cause which has
given rise to them be at once detected, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
appropriate treatment employed, the most
serious consequences may be apprehended.</p>

<p>In these cases, the first step necessary is
to discontinue the suckling altogether: half
measures will never answer. Sometimes it is
proposed by the patient, or her friends (more
usually the latter), to compromise the affair
by feeding the child partly on spoon meat,
and allowing him still to take the breast,
though less frequently than before.</p>

<p>This plan I uniformly object to, for the
following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Because the mother will not be likely
to recover so long as she continues to suckle
at all.</p>

<p>2nd. Because her milk being necessarily
of a bad quality, it cannot be expected that
the child will derive benefit from it; but, on
the contrary, there is every probability that
his health will suffer by using diet of such an
improper description.</p>

<p>The obvious dependence of the foregoing
symptoms upon debility will, of course, at
once suggest to practitioners the nature of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the treatment to be adopted: which should
be such as is calculated to invigorate the
system generally&mdash;namely, the administration
of tonics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Bark and its various preparations, especially
the sulphate of quinine, with the occasional
use of warm aperients (sedulously
avoiding the more violent purgatives), will
be found eminently successful; whereas,
cupping at the nape of the neck (which I
have seen prescribed for the headache), and
other depletory measures, have proved as
manifestly injurious.</p>

<p>'Every disease productive of great weakness
is increased by the state of the system
which follows child-bearing. Of this description
are consumption, dropsy,' &amp;c. In
these cases it is evident that the process of
lactation, by adding to the debility already
present, must prove highly injurious, and
consequently should be always avoided.</p>

<p>I have already noticed the effects which are
produced upon the milk by the influence of
mental emotions on the part of the mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as well as by the recurrence of the periodical
appearance; and since these are chiefly injurious
to the child, by depraving its sustenance,
their further consideration will be
deferred till the next chapter.</p>

<p>With respect to the remaining topic&mdash;namely,
the occurrence of miscarriage from
suckling&mdash;I am convinced that it is by no
means an unfrequent accident, though its
real cause is perhaps rarely suspected, having
only met with one patient who considered the
mishap in question to have arisen from keeping
her child too long at the breast. Having
already, I trust satisfactorily, explained the
manner in which abortion is produced by
the act of suckling, I shall conclude this part
of my subject with the relation of a case that
occurred in private practice, which so strongly
corroborates many of the observations in the
preceding and following pages, that I shall
offer no apology for its introduction: more
particularly, since the lady herself to whom
it refers has benevolently expressed a wish
for its publication, in order that those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
become acquainted with the facts there detailed
may be prevented from undergoing
similar unnecessary sufferings:&mdash;</p>


<h3>CASE.</h3>

<p>Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, a lady of delicate constitution,
about twenty years of age, three or four
months subsequent to the birth of her first
child, began to find her milk gradually lessen
in quantity; it had also much changed from
its previous appearance, resembling at the
time just stated, a yellowish, turbid serum.
Her child became emaciated; and diarrh&#339;a
supervening, my professional services were
required. My advice was, that the child
should be at once weaned, and a suitable
wet-nurse, if possible, procured&mdash;neither of
which suggestions, as will shortly appear,
were followed. I urged the necessity of this
measure more particularly, because Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;
was daily getting thinner and weaker; she
also complained of great pain in the head
and back, and of an increasing dimness of
sight, which made her fear she should become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
blind; but the mother-in-law of my patient
being, unfortunately, of opinion that pregnancy
in the latter would not again occur
during the continuance of lactation, recommended
that the child, although chiefly supported
upon spoon-meat, should occasionally
be allowed to take the breast; and this plan,
notwithstanding the wish of Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; to
the contrary, and my own remonstrances on
the subject, was adopted&mdash;the effects of which
were to increase the mother's ailments, as well
as those of her infant. Things went on thus
for some time longer, when I once more endeavoured
to persuade Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; to follow
my advice, observing, that by an opposite line
of conduct she was not only injuring her own
health, but that of her child, neither of which,
I assured her, in my opinion, would be re-established
till the latter had been weaned.
I expressed also my complete incredulity as
to the non-recurrence of pregnancy in consequence
of her infant remaining at the breast;
and I added&mdash;'It is my firm conviction that
if you be pregnant, or should happen shortly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to become so, you will miscarry.' About a
week after this conversation she was suddenly
seized with flooding, and what I had predicted
took place. She now left off suckling, and
in about a month, under suitable treatment,
completely got rid of all her former complaints:
the child also immediately began to
improve.</p>

<p>The present case clearly proves that the
process of lactation will not <i>invariably</i> prevent
the occurrence of pregnancy, since Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;
became in this state, notwithstanding she continued
to suckle her child: and I think few
will be so hardy as to doubt that it was the
cause of her miscarrying: more particularly
when I mention that, at a future period, the
same lady, during my absence abroad, being
once more persuaded to try whether she could
not avoid becoming pregnant (which was very
much to be desired, on account of her delicate
state of health) by continuing to perform
the duties of a nurse, again suffered all the
distressing symptoms before described, and
again miscarried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>This case, finally, affords evidence of the
evil consequences often produced in children
by impoverished and unhealthy milk; and
of their speedy disappearance when the exciting
cause&mdash;namely, deteriorated milk&mdash;is
no longer afforded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3><i>On the various Diseases which frequently arise in Children
from Lactation, especially when protracted.</i></h3>


<p>Having thus briefly considered some of the
disorders to which women are subjected by
performing the first duty imposed upon them
as mothers, I shall next advert to those which
are very frequently observed in their children
from being suckled during too long a period;
or in consequence of the nurse's milk becoming
either simply impoverished, or of a
positively injurious quality.</p>

<p>These diseases are numerous, and some of
them serious, among which may be enumerated
the following; namely, vomiting, diarrh&#339;a,
general debility, scrofula, tabes mesenterica,&mdash;rickets,
convulsions, epilepsy,&mdash;and
lastly meningitis, or that peculiar inflammation
of the investing membranes of the
brain which gives rise to the effusion of serum,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
constituting the well known and very fatal
disease termed by medical practitioners Hydrocephalus,
or Hydrencephalus, and popularly
Water on the Brain.</p>

<p>The disease last mentioned being by far the
most important, and that chiefly referred to
in the following observations, I shall commence
with a brief statement of the conclusions
which my experience has led me to
form respecting it; they are the same I made
public four years ago<a href="#Note_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, having since that
time seen no reason to make any alteration in
them. I believe,</p>

<p>1st,&mdash;That if children be suckled for an
undue length of time<a href="#Note_F" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>, they will be liable in
consequence to be affected with meningitis<a href="#Note_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>,
or inflammation of the investing membranes
of the brain.</p>

<p>2dly,&mdash;That should they not become affected
with the disorder in question during or soon
after the time they are thus improperly
suckled, they will nevertheless acquire therefrom
a predisposition to cephalic disease at
some future period of their lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly,&mdash;That children who are suckled for an
undue length of time, when labouring under
other diseases, will be much more liable to
have the head secondarily affected, than
children brought up in a different manner.</p>

<p>4thly,&mdash;And lastly, that the same effects will
take place in infants if suckled by women who
have been delivered an undue<a href="#Note_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> length of
time; although the infants themselves may
not have been at the breast for too long a
period.</p>

<p>For the five following cases I am indebted
to the kindness of Mr. William Griffith, an
intelligent surgeon of Eaton-street, who, having
some time ago been apprised of my peculiar
views, has since directed his attention
particularly to the subject. They completely
confirm my opinions, and will have more
weight with the public than any additional
evidence I could adduce from my own practice.</p>

<p>In the letter inclosing these cases, Mr.
Griffith writes thus&mdash;'from the observations
I have been enabled to make, I am led to
believe that disease almost invariably follows
protracted suckling. I may add in conclusion,
that I perfectly concur with the views
which you entertain on the subject.'</p>

<h4>CASES XIV. XV.</h4>

<p>'&mdash;&mdash; Jackson, residing at &mdash;&mdash;, aged two
years six months, who had been kept <i>at the
breast twenty-two months</i>, was in a dying state
when I was requested to see her. The pulse
was preternaturally slow&mdash;great stupor&mdash;dilatation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the pupils, and diastasis of the bones of
the head. In six hours from the time I first saw
her she died, and the mother was desirous that
the head should be examined, having lost a child
previously, in what she considered a similar manner.
On removing the scalp I found the cranium
very much enlarged and altered in shape. Between
the tunica arachnoides and pia mater,
there was a quantity of water effused;&mdash;the
sides and upper surface of the brain were exceedingly
soft. In the lateral ventricles there were
from six to eight ounces of water. In answer to a
few questions I asked the mother, she stated that
her former child was, during the <i>first ten months</i>
of its life, <i>a plump, healthy infant</i>,&mdash;<i>after that
period he altered</i>,&mdash;the stomach, bowels, and <i>head
became affected</i>, and, in the course of a few months,
he manifested similar symptoms to those which
proved fatal in the case of his sister. He was
<i>suckled for twenty-one months</i>, and <i>died</i> at the age
of <i>twenty-seven months</i>. The mother of these
children has one other child alive, and at my
urgent request it was weaned at <i>nine months</i>,&mdash;it
is now <i>seventeen months old, and in excellent health</i>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h4>CASE XVI.</h4>

<p>'Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, of &mdash;&mdash;, had a little boy who
at <i>ten months old</i> had nine teeth, which were cut
with little or no difficulty:&mdash;<i>at this time he was in
good health</i>,&mdash;<i>he was allowed the breast until nineteen
months, and at the expiration of three months
more, died of Hydrocephalus</i>.'</p>

<h4>CASE XVII.</h4>

<p>'Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; lost a child of Hydrocephalus,
and has an infant <i>now at the breast seventeen
months old</i>;&mdash;the little patient is frequently suffering
from <i>cerebral disturbance</i>. I have repeatedly
advised the mother to wean it&mdash;she
objects, and gives the usual reason for allowing
it to remain at the breast&mdash;viz., that she does it
to <i>prevent becoming again enceinte</i>.'</p>

<h4>CASE XVIII.</h4>

<p>'This day, (August 13, 1831,) a little child
labouring under <i>cerebral disease</i> was brought to
me for advice, and he appeared certainly in a
most pitiable state; he is <i>two years four months
old</i> and is <i>now at the breast</i>,&mdash;I do not think it
possible for him to survive many days.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

head was large, fontanelle open&mdash;superficial veins
more apparent than natural. By my advice he
was directly weaned, and rapidly improved in
health and appearance (the only medicine given
being occasional doses of castor oil). About
twelve months afterwards, in consequence of an
imprudent exposure to cold, he was attacked with
Bronchitis, and Meningitis supervened. Leeches

with Meningitis, which latter terminated
in effusion. Calomel was then given every two
hours, the stronger mercurial ointment rubbed
upon the temples, and blisters applied to the
head. The mercurial influence being established,
a profuse discharge of urine occurred; the pupils
which had previously been <i>permanently</i> dilated,
became once more obedient to light; sensibility
was restored, and great weakness appeared to be
the only urgent symptom. The cough, however,
now returned, the head became again affected,

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With respect to the manner in which protracted
lactation causes the complaint that
forms the subject of these remarks, I formerly
was undecided; but have now no
doubt whatever of its arising <i>secondarily</i> from
derangement in the functions of the abdominal
viscera, occasioned by the depraved
condition of the breast-milk.</p>

<p>It is universally allowed among medical
men that irritations in the stomach and
bowels will, through the agency of particular
nerves, produce sympathetic irritation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in the brain,&mdash;that peculiar action being thus
elicited which terminates in the effusion of
serum, constituting the disease named Hydrocephalus.&mdash;'The
continued irritation of important
or very sensible nerves is, perhaps,'
says Mr. Burns, '<i>one of the most common causes</i>'
(of Hydrocephalus); 'hence it may follow
dentition, and <i>very often arises from a bad state
of the chylopoietic viscera</i>.'</p>

<p>It is also no less generally known that food
of a bad quality or improper description will
produce derangements in the digestive organs.
Now, having already shewn that the milk
when lactation is protracted becomes deteriorated,
it plainly appears that such milk is
capable of occasioning derangement of the
chylopoietic viscera; and it being allowed
that derangement of these viscera, from any
source, may give rise to inflammation of the
brain, I conceive it follows that protracted
lactation must be admitted as one cause of
such effect. This train of reasoning, therefore,
from generally admitted data, seems to <i>prove
that Meningitis</i>, or inflammation of the brain, <i>in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> children can be produced by their being suckled for
too long a period</i>, and <i>that it is so produced I assert
from repeated experience</i>.</p>

<p>An accidental perusal of Mr. Dendy's able
work on the cutaneous diseases of children,
published shortly after the appearance of my
paper before referred to in the Medical and
Physical Journal, has recently afforded me
the pleasure of finding that the author had
been led to entertain similar general views on
the subject under discussion with myself; I
have, therefore, taken the opportunity of adding
that gentleman's testimony to my own, by
quoting the following passage from his work
above mentioned.</p>

<p>'It may be truly said, that <i>the infantine
disease excited by milk of a deleterious, or simply
impoverished quality, "grows by what it feeds on;"</i>
and we shall witness the internal debility and
the infantine disorder running their course
together. Tabes is the natural consequence
of this error; but its effect is evinced by the
occurrence of other disorders. A defective
degree of nutrition, as I have elsewhere stated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
predisposes the system to become influenced
by comparatively slight excitement; and thus,
in addition to the direct excitement of disease,
it becomes indirectly its predisposing cause.
<i>Under its influence the serous</i><a href="#Note_L" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> and mucous
<i>membranes become readily the seat of inflammatory
action</i>.'</p>

<p>Those who feel a difficulty in relinquishing
old opinions and adopting new views upon
any particular subject, may perhaps ask how
it has happened, if inflammation of the brain
from protracted suckling be so common as
the preceding observations and cases would
appear to prove, that medical men of more
advanced age and far greater experience than
myself have not previously noticed the circumstance.
I would observe, in reply, that
until Harvey pointed out the circulation of
the blood, no one ever suspected the existence
of such a phenomenon; yet now the wonder
appears to be, not that Harvey made the discovery,
but that others had not previously
done the same. Multitudes, it may be added,
and among them the great Newton, had witnessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the fall of objects to the ground without
thinking of the cause which produced their
downward tendency; the propitious moment,
however, arrived&mdash;the apple fell, and the philosopher
was led to those deductions which
have rendered his name immortal. So is it
with observers of every class, from those most
distinguished by intellectual superiority and
its successful application, down to the humble
writer of the present observations. Facts
are continually passing before us unnoticed,
till, from their repeated coincidence, or some
accidental impulse, we attempt, and finally
are enabled, to trace their origin.</p>

<p>Thus, until the possibility of Meningitis
originating from protracted lactation had
been suggested, practitioners were, of course,
unable to notice the fact&mdash;not from its non-occurrence,
but because their unconsciousness
of its existence must necessarily preclude
the inquiries from which alone its cause
could be determined. Hence a practitioner
may have treated many hundred cases of
water on the brain in children, without being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
able to attribute any one of them to protracted
suckling; yet this is no proof that
such cases did not happen, for, had he made
the requisite inquiries, very probably many
among them might have been found which
had thus arisen.</p>

<p>Another objection that may possibly be
made to my views, is, that instances might
be adduced where lactation had been persevered
in for a very long period, without any
ill effects supervening. That such frequently
occur, there is no doubt; and with respect to
them, I have merely to observe, that they do
not in the slightest degree invalidate the correctness
of my conclusions. As well might
it be argued, that because persons have fallen
from a very great height without sustaining
any injury, or, because poisonous doses of
various drugs have sometimes been swallowed
without death supervening, that, therefore,
there is no danger in jumping from a precipice,
or in taking a virulent poison; or that
death never occurs from these causes. Such
cases, unless far more numerous than I imagine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
them, can only be regarded as exceptions
to the general rule; and, consequently,
do not lessen its authority, there being no rule
without an exception.</p>

<p>Some practitioners, with whom I have conversed
on the subject, though willing to allow
that protracted suckling, by depraving the
milk, may be the means of occasioning Meningitis
in infants during or shortly after the
time they are supplied with this improper
food, yet could not conceive how it can act as
a cause of that disease at some future period;
I do not myself, while attempting to account
for it, discover any pathological difficulty.</p>

<p>In these cases it is very probable, that
although the protracted suckling was not
sufficient to produce actual Meningitis at its
conclusion, yet that it so weakened the
system in general, and the brain in particular,
as to render the latter especially predisposed
to inflammatory action; and that
we have reason to suppose this not only
possible, but probable, from analogy, cannot
be denied, since it is known that scrofulous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
children, in whom there is great laxity and
debility of habit, are inordinately liable to be
affected with Hydrocephalus, or Water in
the Brain.</p>

<p>'Dr. Perceval observes, that of twenty-two
cases of which he kept notes, <i>eleven were certainly
strumous children</i>, and <i>four were probably
so</i>.' 'From my own observations,' remarks
Dr. Cheyne, 'I should think this proportion
a very moderate one. When a whole family
is swept away by Hydrocephalus, I suspect
<i>it is intimately connected with this strumous taint</i>.'
The testimony of Sauvages may also be adduced,
who says, 'Novi familiam cujus infantes
circa sextum &aelig;tatis annum omnes periere
ex hoc morbo, <i>Scrofula huic effusioni ansam
pr&aelig;bente</i>.' The brain, in consequence of this
local debility, may become affected from
causes which otherwise would, perhaps, have
produced no injurious consequences whatever;
and hence it is, that when labouring
under other diseases, and especially Hooping-cough,
those children who have been suckled
too long appear so very liable to have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
head secondarily affected. It is worthy of
notice, that among the cases which have been
detailed in the foregoing pages, were fourteen
in whom affection of the head supervened
during the progress of other diseases, and in
ten of them the disease was Hooping-cough.</p>

<p>The treatment of Meningitis arising from
protracted suckling will not differ from what
is proper when it has been produced by other
causes; except that the depletory measures
should not be carried to so great an extent, as
it must be remembered that the disease is
existing in constitutions <i>already debilitated</i>.</p>

<p>It should consist generally in the application
of leeches to the temples&mdash;cold lotions
to the head&mdash;purgatives, and blisters placed
behind the ears, the discharge from which is
to be kept up by means of irritating dressings&mdash;these
afford the surest chance of subduing
the malady, and in many instances, if
employed sufficiently early, will have the desired
effect. It is, of course, almost superfluous
to observe, that weaning, if the child
be above nine months old, must be immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
enforced; or, if considerably younger,
the diseased or debilitated nurse ought to be
exchanged for one who has a supply of healthy
milk of a corresponding age. If such
cannot be procured, the child must be
brought up by hand; for, so long as it is allowed
to imbibe the noxious milk, there is little
hope, in my mind, of the medical treatment
being of any great service; while on the contrary,
it is encouraging to know that many
infants previously manifesting symptoms of
incipient Meningitis have completely recovered
<i>soon after they were weaned</i><a href="#Note_M" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>.</p>

<p>When my attention first became directed
to the subject, I was chiefly struck with the ill
effects resulting to the child from <i>protracted</i>
lactation, and hence supposed that cases of
disease from suckling, when continued for
only a moderate period, were rarely if ever
met with. More enlarged experience, however,
has now convinced me, that not only are
ill effects occasioned in children when lactation
is protracted to a very unusual extent,
but that they occur sometimes, when its duration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
has been merely a few months beyond
what I conceive is right. Besides which, we
shall find that when from any cause whatever
the nurse's milk becomes impoverished and
deteriorated, even if this take place at an early
period after delivery, the injurious effects
already referred to may be produced in the
child: for improper food, whether it be bad
milk or any other inappropriate article of
diet, is always calculated to derange the
functions of the stomach, bowels, and other
chylopoietic viscera, and in consequence to
occasion disease.</p>

<p>It matters not whether the mother be originally
unhealthy, and thus her milk possess
bad qualities; or whether from accidental circumstances,
or her continuing to give suck
too long it becomes so: in either case the
same effect, namely, <i>deteriorated milk</i>, is produced,
with the concomitant evils to which I
have alluded. This view of the matter is corroborated
by Case <span class="smcap">LII.</span>, in which true Meningitis
attacked a child, aged only nine months,
who, therefore, was not suckled <i>too long</i>,&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
then the nurse of that child had been
delivered <i>twenty-one months</i>, having suckled
another infant previously:&mdash;hence we may
reasonably conclude that her milk being from
the beginning deteriorated, and unadapted to
the age of the child, the ill effects in this case
were produced at a much earlier period than
usual.</p>

<p>It will be observed that I have only given
<i>one</i> instance of this latter description; but,
on considering how very rare it must be to
find any mother capable of abandoning her
newly-born infant to the breast of a woman
who has already suckled another child one
year, any surprise that might be felt at the
circumstance will, I am sure, immediately
cease. It must also be noticed that only
among the lowest grades of society do we find
women so long after delivery performing the
office of wet-nurse at all, and those who entrust
their infants to the latter are often so
peculiarly situated as to feel no interest whatever
in the preservation of their offspring:
indeed I cannot but suspect that, among such,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
criminal motives frequently lead to the adoption
of the unnatural and baneful practice in
question.</p>

<p>I do not recollect to have seen a case of
Meningitis from suckling except when this
process had been <i>protracted</i>, either as respects
the child or the nurse; though I by no means
doubt the possibility of its occurrence under
other circumstances: but I have met with
numerous instances of other diseases produced
by the palpable deterioration of the mother's
or nurse's milk at various periods after delivery;
in by far the greater number, however,
of such cases, lactation had been continued
for an unusual length of time.</p>

<p>Vomiting, griping, and diarrh&#339;a, are so
common among infants, and arise in general
from causes apparently so evident, that, unless
severe or of long duration, they rarely form
the subject of minute inquiry. Hence these
complaints are, perhaps, not so often attributed
to deteriorated milk as they ought to
be, although the fact of their occasionally
originating from a morbid condition of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
fluid, (and therefore from protracted lactation
as one cause of the latter effect,) is too well
established to be questioned. Dr. Underwood
observes, 'has not every Physician of
experience seen infants frequently thrown
into tormina immediately after coming from
the <i>breast of an unhealthy mother, or one who has
but little milk</i>?'<a href="#Note_N" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> and Mr. Burns states, that
if the usual periodical appearance should
return, 'the milk is liable to disagree with
the child, and produce vomiting or purging;'
while Dr. Hamilton expressly mentions that
diarrh&#339;a is 'not unfrequently <i>occasioned by
the depraved quality of the nurse's milk</i>.'</p>

<p>The two former authors merely testify to
the fact of diseases being produced by the
milk, while the latter more explicitly mentions
the cause from which they proceed.</p>

<p>Debility, Tabes Mesenterica, and Scrofula,
may also be traced to the same origin, as
every practitioner of experience must have
repeatedly observed: so may that intractable
disease, termed Rickets; and it is worthy of
notice, that among the worst instances of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
malady I have seen, were two sisters, <i>who had
been suckled for a very unusual period</i>. Neither
do I doubt the probability of Epilepsy being
similarly occasioned; and although, I must
candidly own, I cannot produce numerous
cases in proof of the correctness of such
hypothesis, yet I recollect that of a girl
affected with this complaint, respecting whom
the mother stated (and I recorded the fact at
the time) that she had been '<i>suckled for two
years</i>;' and, to use her own expression, had
'never been well since.'<a href="#Note_O" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>Convulsions arising from protracted suckling,
or simply from the nurse's milk becoming
deteriorated at any period, are very common,
and I have kept notes of many such cases
that have occurred in the course of my own
practice; which, however, I abstain from
here inserting, being anxious to prevent the
present publication from swelling into a volume.
Indeed, the occurrence of convulsions
from this cause (diseased milk) has been mentioned
by several of the best authors. Mr.
North, in particular, (whose excellent work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
on Convulsions should be in the hands of
every practitioner) observes&mdash;'It cannot be
doubted that children suffer, that their health
is destroyed, and the foundation laid for convulsive
diseases, by <i>sucking unhealthy nurses</i>.'
'A predisposition to convulsive affections in
children may be originally produced in consequence
of their being suckled by a nurse
addicted to the frequent use of spirituous
liquors. In several instances I have known
children rapidly recover their health when
the nurse was changed, who had exhibited
most of the premonitory symptoms of convulsions
while they were suckled by a woman
who indulged in the common vice of gin-drinking.'
And Mr. Burns also makes the
following remark&mdash;'Violent passions of the
mind affect the milk still more;&mdash;it often
becomes thin and yellowish, and <i>causes</i> colic,
or even <i>fits</i>.' It is needless, however, to say
more on this topic, since it is one which no
longer admits of discussion.</p>

<p>The reader may now, perhaps, expect that
I shall introduce a series of practical deductions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
from the foregoing facts and observations;
but such is not my object upon the
present occasion. I merely wish to call the
attention of practitioners and the public to
the subject of these pages, and shall thus
discharge, as I conceive, an imperative duty
to society. Having mentioned what I am induced
to consider a frequent cause of inflammation
of the investing membranes of the
brain in children, my undertaking is completed.
The Profession does not require, and
the public would not be benefited, by the
addition of lengthened therapeutical rules;
for I am convinced, there is not a greater
imposition to be found than the doctrine that
non-medical persons can treat diseases with
success by means of popular systems of medicine,
'<i>practical</i>' treatises, &amp;c. Such books
have often done irreparable mischief&mdash;certainly
much more harm than good; and so
far from injuring the profits of medical practitioners
(as some appear to suppose), have
greatly added to the number of their patients.</p>

<p>I avail myself also of this opportunity to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
enter my protest against the ill-judged and
mischievous practice of those patients who
confide upon many occasions in the opinion
of their nurse, rather than that of their medical
attendant, and who, in consequence, often
injure themselves essentially by deceiving the
latter. With respect to this mistaken preference,
Dr. Dewes has well observed&mdash;'Let
it not be hastily assumed that there is more
safety in following the directions of a nurse
than those of the physician, because she may
have had some experience; for it must be
quickly perceived that the calculation is
much in favour of the latter, since the nurse
can attend but twelve patients per annum,
while the physician may visit many hundreds
in the same period&mdash;besides, his knowledge
of the laws of the human system gives him
a very decided superiority.'</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is right to observe, that
protracted suckling being a custom much
more prevalent among females of the lower
orders than those of a superior rank, it must
follow as a necessary consequence, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<i>Meningitis, and other disorders resulting from this
cause, are proportionably less frequent in private
than in public practice</i>. This remark, it is evident,
should be remembered, in order to
obviate apparent discrepancies which otherwise
might appear irreconcilable with the
opinions I have expressed. In the truth of
those opinions I feel the most perfect confidence,
and cannot but hope that their promulgation
will hereafter prove extensively
beneficial, since precautionary, and even
therapeutical measures may be founded upon
them, which, if uniformly adopted, will not
only prevent much ill-health and suffering to
mothers, but will also afford the means of
saving many children from perishing by one
of the most painful and fatal diseases to which
they are subject.</p>

I shall feel greatly obliged to any practitioners

the truth of the doctrine contained in
the preceding pages; and should I be enabled

it is, perhaps, unnecessary to
say, I shall not neglect the opportunity of

<p>It is a curious fact, which I believe has not been noticed
by any other writer, that female children labouring under
attacks of Meningitis are sometimes affected with leucorrh&#339;al
discharges. I have met with several cases of
this description: the children also of women subject to
leucorrh&#339;a will often, at an early age, be found affected
with the same disease. Hence it would appear that leucorrh&#339;a
is occasionally hereditary.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable, notwithstanding the scepticism of
some practitioners on the subject, (whose opinions are
entitled to deference,) that <i>recovery may take place,
under appropriate treatment, in cases of Meningitis, even
after effusion has unequivocally occurred</i>. Preceding
authors have noticed this fact, which I can confirm by my
own experience. Practitioners cannot be too frequently
reminded of it, and warned not to despair of success even
in the last stage of Hydrencephalus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
